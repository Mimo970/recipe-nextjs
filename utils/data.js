Chop the onion into small pieces and saute in  cup butter over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly translucent. Turn heat down to low and add both cans of soup, stirring until mixed well. Remove from heat and set aside.In a prepared 9 x 13 baking dish place a layer of tortillas to cover the bottom of the dish. Add a thin layer of tomatoes and green chilis, a thin layer of the soup mixture, a thin layer of chicken, and top with cheese. Add another thin layer of tortillas, tomatoes and green chilis, soup mixture, chicken, and cheese. Keep doing the layers until you run out of space, finally covering the dish with the remaining cheese.Bake in the preheated oven on 350 for 45 minutes, or until cheese is turned a golden brown.

      instructions:
        'In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy.\nIn a separate small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and salt. Set aside.\nAdd the sugar to the butter and beat until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low and mix in the molasses, egg and balsamic vinegar. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl and continue mixing until thoroughly combined.\nCover and chill about 2 hours or until the dough is easy to handle.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees.\nDivide the dough in half and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll each half of the dough to 1/4" thickness adding flour as needed, the dough is very sticky so use flour liberally to prevent your cutouts from sticking to the surface.\nUsing cookie cutters, cut dough into shapes and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment approximately 1" apart.\nBake in a 400 degree oven for 5-6 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for one minute and move to a wire rack.\nIn a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. Whisk to combine. Spoon mixture into a pastry bag or zip top bag and snip off the tip. Add two small dots of icing where the eyes should be and then press one eye on each dot. Decorate the mummies using a zig-zag pattern across the surface of the cookie and allow to dry for 2-4 hours or overnight.\nStore in an airtight container.',

      instructions:
        'Preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nZucchini:  Cut stem tips of zucchinis off and discard. Slice lengthwise into two pieces. Take a teaspoon and hollow out each half... scraping away seeds and core until smooth. Be sure to leave about 1/4 inch of flesh or the flute will be too weak. Set on baking tray.\nMousse:  Put the ricotta, basil, garlic, and half of the shredded Parmesan cheese into a food processor and blend until creamy. If too thick... add just a dab of olive oil. But not too much as you need the mousse to stand firm in the zucchini flutes.\nOnce you reach the desired consistency - scoop the mousse out of processor into a zip lock baggie or pastry bag. If using a baggie, snip off about 1/4" of the corner and squeeze baggie to pipe out mousse into the hollowed section of the zucchini. Stop short of the end by about 1/2", as the ricotta will expand when baking. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese along the top of flutes.\nPut tray of mousse-filled flutes on middle rack of oven, baking for 20 minutes at 375 degrees. Remove when zucchini is tender to a fork and the cheese has browned slightly. Once flutes are removed from the oven, sprinkle a few ricotta crumbles across the top and lightly drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Serve immediately.',

      instructions:
        "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar.  Beat in eggs then stir in the cream, milk, liqueur, cinnamon, vanilla and bread.  Once well combined fold in the sliced bananas carefully.  Pour into a 13x9 baking dish and cook for 90 minutes or until completely set.  This can be served hot, room temp or cold. It can be topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or as I did with the following topping.\nIn a sauce pan over medium high heat melt the butter then add the brown sugar.  Once melted add the banana slices and stir gently, cook until the syrup has reduced and the bananas have caramelized.  This will take about 5-10 minutes, be careful to not let your sugar burn. When ready ladle some of this hot sauce over each serving of bread pudding.",

      instructions:
        "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick saute pan over medium heat. Add in the chopped shallot, garlic and bacon, cooking until the shallot softens and then bacon begins to crisp up nicely.\nToss in the mushrooms (make sure you've sliced any large ones), sauteing everything together for another 5-6 minutes, or until the mushrooms reach your desired consistency (tender, but not falling apart).\nMeanwhile, cook the pasta until it is al dente. I prefer to use a nice whole wheat fettuccine for this recipe as it pairs well with the nuttiness of the mushrooms. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and set aside.\nAdd the peas and parsley to the skillet, season with salt and pepper and cook for just a minute or two before tossing in the pasta and mixing well, coating the pasta with the oils and fat.\nRemove the skillet from the heat and put the pasta into a large serving bowl. Shave a generous amount of Parmeggiano Reggiano over the dish, tossing to combine.\nServe with additional cheese and salt and fresh pepper, to your liking.",

        "Pat dry the swordfish. In a plate mix together the panko, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, dry sage and marjoram and the salt and pepper. Mix well.\nIn another plate place the milk or cream.\nDip the swordfish into the milk and let any excess drip away.\nRoll into the panko-parmesan mixture and press it against the swordfish to adhere.\nIn a large skillet melt 2 tablespoons of butter. When melted add the swordfish and cook until nicely golden on each side and the fish is springy yet cooked.\nRemove the swordfish from the skillet and let it rest while preparing the sauce.\nRemove all the cooking butter from the skillet and place the skillet over medium high heat.\nAdd the orange juice and reduce by half.\nAdd the butter remaining, the sugar and reduce until a thick sauce is crated.\nServe the sauce over the fish or alongside.\nIf the sauce is too thick and too tangy; add a bit more sugar and swirl in another tablespoon of butter.",
